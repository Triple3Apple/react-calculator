# Calculator App in React.js

**Click the link to see the Calculator App in action: [triple3apple.github.io/react-calculator/](https://triple3apple.github.io/react-calculator/)**

### Reason for Making the App

I created this app to reinforce my knowledge on React.js by making something original but familiar without the use of a tutorial.

### Just a calculator?

Other than the ability to perform math operations, the calculator app I created in **React** features 3 selectable color themes with smooth color transitions. I also made the app's UI responsive for mobile devices. Works on every browser except Internet Explorer.

#### **Utilized:** React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Project idea from **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)**

The color schemes are also provided by Frontend Mentor (View the file `style-guide.md` for details)
